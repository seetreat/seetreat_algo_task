# seetreat_coding_task

Your task is to write code capable of identifying and counting the number of stop signs in an image. There are three images in the folder called `test_images`, ordered by how challenging they are. You can stop after your code works for the first image, or keep going if you're enjoying the challenge!

- Solutions are welcome in Python or C++
- The use of third-party libraries is heavily encouraged
- We will be attempting to use this code, so you should write documentation accordingly. 
- We are just as interested in how well the code is structured as we are in how well it performs. Consider things like: “How easy would this be to extend?” and “How easy would this be to test?
- Bonus points for adding at least one test case using an automated test framework.
